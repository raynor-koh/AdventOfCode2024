# Advent of Code 2024
## Goals for this iteration
This is my first time doing the Advent of Code so please forgive me if my solutions are not elegant or not the best time complexity. 
I started this as a way to refresh my Python skills after a long time and I had an internship which uses Python heavily coming up.
Hence, I thought that trying out this year's iteration of AOC using Python could help to refresh my Python knowledge.

1) Refresh the general Python skills
2) Get better at using numpy and other scientific Python libraries
